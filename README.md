• This app serves primarily as a visual portfolio showcasing the projects I’ve developed so far. Rather than focusing heavily on data processing or complex analytics, the core emphasis is on demonstrating the <b>fundamentals</b> of data access and interaction.<br>
• While building this app, I gained valuable experience in several key areas. I learned how to efficiently access and manipulate data stored in <b>CSV</b> files, and I started working with the <b>pandas</b> library to handle and display that data effectively. I also deepened my understanding of <b>app design</b> principles, including layout, user flow, and maintaining clean, modular code.<br>
• One of the most insightful aspects of the project was working with <b>email functionality</b> — specifically, understanding how to use the <b>SMTP protocol</b> to send emails programmatically from the app. A highlight of this feature was implementing a simple but effective security measure: I used environment variables within a <b>virtual environment</b> to securely handle sensitive information like email passwords, keeping them out of the codebase and version control.<br>
• Overall, this project helped me strengthen my foundational skills in Python development, data access, and secure app design.<br><br>

• Below I'll attach the views from the app:<br>
